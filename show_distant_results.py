print("\nInterpretation:")
print("  - Multiple basins of attraction exist in weight space")
print("  - Each basin has its own low-dimensional manifold")
print("  - Standard initialization finds one basin (our 8D manifold)")
print("  - Distant initialization finds different basins")
print("  - The basins are FAR apart (not connected)")
print("\nThis explains:")
print("  ✓ Why initialization matters in deep learning")
print("  ✓ Why the 'universal subspace' is actually basin-specific")
print("  ✓ Why we saw models NOT return to the original manifold")
print("\nThe structure is:")
print("  - Weight space contains multiple basins")
print("  - Each basin has a low-D manifold (attractor)")
print("  - SGD converges to manifold within its basin")
print("  - But cannot easily jump between basins")
